## Research Question  

How can different prompting methods impact the efficiency, structure, and accuracy of AI-generated requirement analysis?  

## Arguments  

### What is already known about this topic?  
- Prompt engineering techniques influence the quality of AI-generated responses.  
- Automation levels determine the balance between control and flexibility.  
- Parameter tuning (temperature, context window, max tokens) affects AI behavior.  
- AI can self-improve responses through iterative prompting methods.  

### What this research is exploring  
We systematically analyze 10 prompting techniques across three automation levels  

#### Level-0 Automation (Basic Prompting)  
- Zero-shot prompting  
- Few-shot prompting  
- Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting  
- Self-consistency prompting  

#### Level-1 Automation (Structural Enhancements)  
- Meta-prompting  
- Prompt templates  
- Instruction-tuned prompting  

#### Level-2 Automation (AI-Driven Refinements)  
- Adaptive prompting  
- Hierarchical prompt chaining  
- Recursive self-improvement  

### Implications for Practice  
- Level-0 techniques provide raw structure but require manual optimization.  
- Level-1 techniques introduce automated structuring and templates for better clarity.  
- Level-2 techniques leverage AI self-improvement and multi-step refinement to optimize responses.  
- Parameter tuning (temperature, max tokens, context length) improves model behavior.

## Results and Analysis  

### Parameter Observations  

- **Temperature**  
  - 0.7 and 0.8 were used for most tests as they balance creativity and structure.  
  - 0.3 was chosen in some cases to force a more structured and deterministic output, reducing unnecessary variation.  
  - 0.5 was used for scenarios where moderate randomness was needed to improve self-improvement prompting.  

- **Context Window (num_ctx)**  
  - For Level-0 techniques, num_ctx was kept between 100 and 400 to limit unnecessary complexity.  
  - For Level-1 and Level-2 techniques, num_ctx was increased to 512-728 to ensure the AI could process multiple-step refinements effectively.  

- **Max Tokens**  
  - 200-300 tokens were sufficient for short tasks.  
  - 400-800 tokens provided structured and detailed Requirement Analysis.

### Technique Observations  

#### Level-0 Automation: Basic Prompting  

Zero-Shot Prompting  
- AI generated Requirement Analysis without examples.  
- Strength: Fast and efficient.  
- Weakness: Output lacked structure and clarity.  

Few-Shot Prompting  
- AI was given multiple examples before generating responses.  
- Strength: Improved structure and accuracy.  
- Weakness: Required manual example selection.  

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting  
- AI broke down reasoning steps for structured analysis.  
- Strength: Increased logical accuracy.  
- Weakness: Longer responses than needed.  

Self-Consistency Prompting  
- AI generated multiple responses and selected the most consistent one.  
- Strength: Improved accuracy and logical coherence.  
- Weakness: Computationally expensive.

#### Level-1 Automation: Structured Prompting  

Meta-Prompting  
- AI generated a prompt for itself to refine its Requirement Analysis.  
- Strength: Reduced human effort in writing prompts.  
- Weakness: Sometimes too generic.  

Prompt Templates  
- Used predefined structures for Requirement Analysis.  
- Strength: Ensured consistency.  
- Weakness: Limited flexibility.  

Instruction-Tuned Prompting  
- AI was given explicit step-by-step instructions.  
- Strength: Increased precision.  
- Weakness: AI struggled with vague instructions.

#### Level-2 Automation: AI-Driven Optimization  

Adaptive Prompting  
- AI dynamically modified its own prompts based on feedback.  
- Strength: Improved self-learning.  
- Weakness: Risk of feedback loops.  

Hierarchical Prompt Chaining  
- AI broke tasks into multiple steps and refined output progressively.  
- Strength: High accuracy and clarity.  
- Weakness: Longer response time.  

Recursive Self-Improvement  
- AI reviewed, critiqued, and optimized its own response iteratively.  
- Strength: Best for optimizing structured output.  
- Weakness: Can generate overly verbose responses.

## Further Research  

1. Test additional hybrid techniques for improved AI optimization.  
2. Experiment with different AI models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude, Mistral).  
3. Optimize Level-2 automation by implementing reinforcement learning.  
4. Evaluate techniques across industries (e.g., healthcare, finance, legal).
